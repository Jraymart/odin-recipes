To practice the HTML knowledge acquired from The Odin Project,
A basic recipe website will be made.

The website will have:
- A main index page
- Links to a few recipes

Recipe pages should have:
- an image
- Description heading
- Paragraph describing the recipe
- unordered list of ingredients needed for the recipe
- ordered list of steps needed to make the dish
CSS will be added in the future.
